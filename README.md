## Treasure Chart Locator | [Link](https://aoguides.myalt.dev/treasure)
The Treasure Chart Locator is designed to help players efficiently find buried treasure in Arcane Odyssey by interpreting in-game treasure chart clues.

### Features

* **Island Selection:** Choose the island from the list by searching.
* **Clue Input:** Enter treasure chart details to be displayed on map:
    * Cardinal direction (e.g., North, Southwest)
    * Distance from the center of the island (e.g., "Few paces," "Halfway," "Edge")
* **Visual Map Display:** Shows a map of the selected island with the potential treasure locations highlighted based on input.
* **Grid Overlay:** Option to display full grid overlay.
* **Mobile Friendly:** Designed to be usable on various devices.

### Potential Issues

* **Map Accuracy:** Some islands might be shifted, and some parts may extend beyond the highlighted area.
* **Missing Islands:** Newly added islands might not be updated, and small islands are not displayed. Please DM myaltaccountsthis or create a GitHub issue.

### Tips

* Dig around a wider area than displayed to guarantee finding the treasure.
* Keep in mind the height and material on the chart.
* Ground parts are always rectangular, so extruding areas are likely separate parts.

## Armor Build Calculator | [Link](https://aoguides.myalt.dev/armor)
The Armor Build Calculator helps players plan and optimize their armor and accessory setups in Arcane Odyssey. Specify calculator settings and click update to calculate and display the top 50 builds.

### Features

* **Armor Filter:** Choose to include or exclude certain armor pieces
* **Enchants, Sunken, and Modifiers:** Choose whether or not to use exotic enchants, modifiers, or sunken.
* **Multiplier and Efficiency Points:** Calculates multiplier (perceived advantage against unarmored opponent) and efficiency points (normalized total stats)
* **Weights:** Specify weights for each stat (ex. +100% size = +50% multiplier for size weight of 50)
* **Copy Settings:** Can copy and paste settings to save filters and specifications
* **Drawback, Insanity, and Warding:** Manually choose your desired amount for each of these stats.
* **Vitality and Fight Duration:** Specify your vitality and fight duration (in seconds). Vitality will change the power-defense balance while fight duration favors regeneration.

### Potential Issues

* **Updates:** Balance changes can change stats or add new armors. Please DM afakeusername or create a GitHub issue.
* **Missing Armors:** Not all armors are in the catalog. Armors with direct upgrades or poor efficiency points are excluded.
* **Secondary Stats:** Calculations for secondary stat-based builds may not truly reflect their actual benefit. Use weights or min stats to counter this.

### Tips

* Choose reasonable weights for each stat, min stats if needed
* Copy a build into gear builder website to further customize
* Jewels, enchants, and modifiers can be usually be shuffled around (unless Virtuous or Atlantean)
* Calculator should run faster with more restrictions
